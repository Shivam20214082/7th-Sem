# **7th Semester Academic Code Repository**

## **Overview**

Welcome to my **7th Semester Academic Code Repository**, where I’ve compiled all the projects and assignments developed during this semester. The repository spans multiple subjects such as **Distributed Systems**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Project Work**. The goal is to consolidate all academic work in one place, making it accessible for future reference, learning, and sharing.
